# Jumpstart-Practice-Problems

>I learned the basics of coding in Ruby by following [**Ada Developers Academy's Jumpstart**](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start) curriculum. Here I have recorded the assignments that I completed. I started this Project in early January of 2017. Figuring out how to create a repository and gists on GitHub was harder than the coding process! 

>I would recommend this curriculum to anyone who wishes to learn basic coding. It was straightforward and comprehensive. The lessons are broken down into easy to follow and simple steps. I do have some practice in coding prior to this class. I took a C++ class in college. However, these lesson plans are non-imtimidating and well organized. Although I was a bit cautious to start this project because I feared that the material will be too complicated, I am glad I took the leap! 

>Please feel free to critique my formatting and coding. I just learned how to format in markdown and would love to hear your thoughts on my publishing.
